I'm a software QA Analyst  who is passionate about building communities and empowering the Spanish speaking community in many countries. Some technologies I enjoy working with include VSCode, Azure Devops, GitHub. My interest in growing communities led me to start participating as an organizer of events such as conferences, Meetups, tech interviews and creating documentation to make these processes easier. Volunteer as coordinator of GitHub-related events in Latin America at GitHub Â¡Presente! en EspaÃ±ol. If you like to share knowledge with tech  communities, let's talk!!
